##THINGS HAVE TO KNOW: 
___

#### 1. Redux actually is for state management (kind of store management) it will deal with your huge complex data system. IT will separete your data as a simple way but in a one store. and this separation willbe done with REDUCER. 
___
#### 2. REDUCER is a function that returns a specific portion of data or a state. That means it will work for the separation and the Distribution of your data. Simply it will reduce your data complexity thats why it is called REDUCER.
___
#### 3. Without a Reducer You can not create a state. That means it plays a vital role in redux.
___
#### 4. In Redux , Every single events is called ACTION. Pressing buttons , and event triggering, browser loading , giving inputs, etc each and every single live or dead events is ACTION in Redux. When an Action is occured , Reducer dispatch some  exact amount of data for helping the Action to be an Action.
___
#### 6. As an example: We see videos in youtube from different channels. If we want to get updated about their videos what we do ? We do SUBSCRIBE , so that we dont need to search for the channel anymore, when there will be any further update on those channels then we will be informed automatically right ? This concept is almost same in REDUX. when parent component will update then subscriber child component will also update automatically as they subscribe to the parent component.
___
#### 7. STORE IS AN OBJECT.
___
#### PURE FUNCTION : It will take only input and do something what is defined to do in a function body. That means :
A pure function is a function which:
Given the same input, will always return the same output.
Produces no side effects.

Pure functions are also extremely independent â€” easy to move around, refactor, and reorganize in your code, making your programs more flexible and adaptable to future changes.

#### 10. You have to create a REDUCER first in order to create a store.
___
#### 11. REDUX makes data flow transparent and predictable. It can answer (why,when,how,where?) of the data change.
___

#### 12. ACTION itself is an object. not a function.
___
#### 13. DISPATCH says to ACTION to do THE PARTICULAR things .
